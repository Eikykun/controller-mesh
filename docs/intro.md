# Controller Mesh

KusionStack Controller Mesh is a solution that helps developers manage their controllers/operators better.

The design architecture of this project is based on [openkruise/controllermesh](https://github.com/openkruise/controllermesh).

## Key Features

1. **Sharding**: Through relevant configurations, Kubernetes single-point deployed operator applications can be flexibly shard deployed.
2. **Canary upgrade**: Depends on sharding, the controllers can be updated in canary progress instead of one time replace.
3. **Circuit breaker and rate limiter**: Not only Kubernetes operation requests, but also other external operation requests.
4. **Multicluster routing and sharding**.
